Web.config
	-JB Build access controls

Requirements
1. 5 interlinked Web forms (.aspx pages) that display dynamic, database-driven content per team member. To be counted as dynamic, the page must retrieve information 
to and/or write information to the application database using one or more queries written by the team. Pages that access the database only using pre-built ASP.NET 
functionalities (such as the Identity service for logging in or creating accounts) do NOT count toward this requirement.
2. At least 5 database transactions (a transaction includes selecting, inserting, updating, or deleting data from the database) per team member
3. User/Role management for at least 2 roles
4. Preservation of state (may include cookies, session state, application state, cross-page posting, or querystring)
5. 10 different ‘basic’ ASP.NET Web controls (those that map directly to an html tag such as label, textbox, dropdownlist, etc.)
6. 5 different ‘advanced’ ASP.NET Web controls (those that do not map directly to an html tag)
7. Input validation for all free-form user entries that could potentially result in errors
8. 1 user control -JB
9. 1 navigation control
